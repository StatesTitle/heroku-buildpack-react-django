# heroku-buildpack-react-django
Heroku Buildpack for compiling React apps that will be served in a Django app. Large portions of the code, including the entirety of the lib, profile, and vendor folders, are lifted wholesale from the [`heroku/nodejs`](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs) buildpack.
